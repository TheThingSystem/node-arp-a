node-arp-a-x
==========

A node.js native implementation (when possible) of "arp -a"

Why not use [the arp module](https://github.com/teknopaul/arp)?
I dislike parsing programmatic output (which can change at any time),
and prefer using API-based approaches. That's possible for Linux and Mac OS.

Also, I wanted a node.js module that returns the entire ARP table.


Install
-------

    npm install -g --unsafe-perm arp-a-x


API
---

    var arp = require('arp-a-x')
      , tbl = { ipaddrs: {}, ifnames : {} }
      ;

    arp.table(function(err, entry) {
      if (!!err) return console.log('arp: ' + err.message);
      if (!entry) return;

      tbl.ipaddrs[entry.ip] = entry.mac;
      if (!tbl.ifnames[entry.ifname]) tbl.ifnames[entry.ifname] = {};
      tbl.ifnames[entry.ifname][entry.mac] = entry.ip;
    });
